My Watson year is teaching me to be okay with uncertainty. I no longer fixate on sculpting a perfect narrative out of my gap year – it’s impossible to do so anyway. Letting go of this obsession has allowed me to be more flexible, ultimately paving the way for unexpected and invaluable experiences. I’ve had dinner with the great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin, a zoom chat with Jane Goodall, but more important than that, the incredible people I’ve met along the way have completely reshaped my worldview. Precious opportunities come to those who are willing to seize them.

My second quarter of my Watson year revolves around a beautiful Dutch sailing ship with a lovely name – the Oosterschelde. I sailed on it as a tourist first, but I somehow find myself officially part of their voyage team. The three-masted topsail schooner is my home now – a home that travels around the world. I’ve become acquainted with every nook and cranny, from the location of cups and soup bowls to the hidden storage rooms. And I love that I can always return to this floating home in a different corner of the world. I started my quarter in search of familiarity and comfort, but I found it amongst the ever-changing horizons.
