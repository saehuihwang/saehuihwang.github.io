In Kenya, I hesitated to get my hair braided. The fear of cultural appropriation weighed heavy. I didn't want to seem like I was just trying to be trendy without respecting the cultural significance of braids.

I confided in my friends Maggie and Janice, both Kenyan locals. They exchanged some giggles and told me, "HWANG! (my nickname) braids are just one way some like to style hair here; you don't need to be so afraid." They took me to a charming pink-walled hair salon in downtown Kitale. Now that my hair was braided, I became fascinated by how intricate patterns and styles of braids can convey stories and identities in various cultures, such as African and Native American traditions.

The truth is, cultures have _always_ borrowed from one another. No single group can lay exclusive claim to a hairstyle. Cultural exchanges — like a Korean girl wearing African braids — celebrate the beauty of diversity. At the same time, it also requires understanding the significance of these traditions.

Experiences can be powerful, and my braids have taught me that appreciating and learning from different cultures requires empathy, respect, and an open heart. I think these braids are beautiful and practical, and I have Maggie and Janice to thank for giving me the courage to have this experience!
