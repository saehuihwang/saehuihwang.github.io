Over spring break, 14 Caltech students and two professors embarked on a voyage to the Galapagos. On this trip, I hiked volcanoes and snorkeled lagoons, watching Darwin's finches, marine iguanas, and penguins. I connected with nature in a way I never imagined possible before, and I’m filled with wonder and curiosity.

This video is dedicated to Professor Rob Phillips and Professor Victoria Orphan. They are my heroes. They've taught me that I need to be out in the world, seeing things for myself, and to be asking questions. For the first time ever, I felt like these professors truly believed in me and my potential to leave a mark on Earth.
