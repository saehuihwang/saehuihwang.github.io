            I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life straight out
            of Caltech (Later, I would learn that this is a common sentiment). Growing up, thought I would be doing big,
            exciting things. But I just didn't know just what that would be. I couldn't decide
            between all my different passions and felt like I needed time to figure out what I truly loved doing.

          </p>
          <p>
            Through my Watson Project, I wanted to understand science communication in different communities and
            contexts to better
            and in doing so, I wanted to understand how I came to love science and how to help others feel the same way.
            Here is a picture of slightly clueless me before embarking on the trip of a lifetime that changed my
            perspectives forever.

          <p>In Bermuda, where there’s just a single two-way highway across the country and where the nearest coffee
            shop was a 30 minute bus ride away, there are no universities or national laboratories. BIOS is the only
            scientific research station on the island. What was surprising is that, almost equally important as its role
            in deep-sea oceanography research, BIOS holds a critical piece in science education on the island. </p>
          <p>
            During my time with BIOS, I designed a robotics curriculum for their summer STEM programs geared towards
            for local Bermudian students and helped teach the courses.

          <p>My time in Kenya starts with the realization that every
            facet of my identity marks me as an outsider. It’s an inevitable reality that I am treated differently
            because of my skin color. There is no such thing as blending in. Heads turn when I walk past, students
            whisper, and some even reach out to touch my hair. I hear derogatory phrases like “Ching chong!”, or witness
            attempts to mock me with exaggerated kung-fu moves. All of these interactions make me squirm inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these experiences that highlight differences between cultures, What made my experience in Kitale so
            special is the presence of friends who look out for me, making me feel part of a community. EduTab, while
            not a million-dollar Ed-tech startup, go out of their way to ensure I feel at home. They pick me up from the
            airport, arrange breakfasts for me to meet the entire team, share snacks like kangumu, and eagerly explain
            Kenyan customs and lifestyles. Mike listen with genuine interest to my stories about visiting the slums in
            Nairobi, Patrick shares stories about his tribe, Maxwell explain to me the detailed process of slaughtering
            a goat. I forge deep connections with some of the kindest, warmest people I have ever met.

        <p>In Brazil, I hop on a 200-year-old tall ship that is making a global voyage that recreates Charles Darwin's
          journey. For the next several months, I follow the ship around South America,
          from Brazil to Uruguay to Argentina to Chile to Peru, producing professional documentaries with filmmakers and
          local conservationists
          to raise awareness about the conservation work they are doing. I mentored a multinational team of young
          filmmakers and
          conservationists and helped them produce impactful conservation-focused narratives.

        <p>When I landed in Ecuador, I learned that the boat I had arranged to live on had to be grounded for repair. If
          the
          Watson Year has taught me anything, it is to be flexible and resourceful. I went to a region called Riobamba
          where
          I got to be a part of a professional video production project about the natural sights of the Highlands of the
          Andes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the welcoming family who embraced me and shared their lives, I experienced Riobamba as they do. To
          me, the Chimborazo volcano is not remembered by a typical touristy photo but by the stories of Juan-Carlos and
          Karen taking Lisa on her first camping trip there. It’s the same volcano that will be one of the first things
          Natalie’s newborn will see in her life. My memories of Riobamba are filled with moments like taking Matteo and
          Ragnar the crazy two-year-old for $3 haircuts, and laughing uncontrollably with Lisa at the stray dog that
          followed our car for miles. I learned to love without a common language.

        <p>In France, I had the opportunity to attend the Cannes Film Festival where there was a big conference
          about how Artificial intelligence is affecting the film industry. Communicating science properly and in an
          accessible manner is more important than ever and I started thinking that I want to be more serious about
          being a good storyteller in science. </p>
