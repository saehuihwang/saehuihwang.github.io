## Teaching

Teaching has shaped my academic career and travels. It thrills me to share the exciting things that I am learning myself, and I am constantly looking for ways to deliver material effectively. Below are some courses I've had the privilege to TA.

#### <b>Intro. to Programming in the Biological Sciences @EPFL</b><br/>

<a class='m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm' href='https://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2023_epfl/'>2023</a><br/>
A week long course attended by graduate students, and post-docs from various departments at EPFL. The course teaches the principles of programming, and students apply the skills to solving biological problems.

#### <b>Statistical Inference in the Biological Sciences @TU Dresden</b><br/>

<a class='m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm' href='https://justinbois.github.io/dd-pol/2023/'>2023</a>

A week long course taught at the Physics of Life Cluster of Excellence (TU Dresden). Frequentist approaches to statistical inferences were explored while equipping graduate students and post-docs with phython-based techniques to analyze quantitiative data in physical biology.

#### <b>Introduction to Mechatronics</b><br/>

<a class='m-1 btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm' href='http://wolverine.caltech.edu/eeme7/index.htm'>2022</a>

This is a lab-based mechatronics class for Caltech undergraduates. Topics covered include motors, piezoelectric devices, light sensors, ultrasonic transducers, and navigational sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes.
