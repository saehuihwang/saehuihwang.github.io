I am currently on a one year solo trip to study how science education is being conducted around the world. I am a 2022 recipeint of the Watson Fellowship, which grants recent college graduates the ability to explore a project of their choosing around the world. Driven by my passion for sharing scientific techniques, I am visiting schools, NGOs, educators and legislators to understand and propagate effective methods for science education.

I am an electrical engineer by training, data science enthusiast by hobby. I am also a crafter. I'm always thinking of how to combine my skills to better understand the natural world.
