# Dyson AirWrap &trade; Stand

As someone who didn’t study mechanical engineering in undergrad, I’ve always felt a bit like a fake engineer. Coming to Stanford, I was determined to make use of the amazing makerspaces for which Stanford is famous for, and I started by enrolling in ME203:Design and Manufacturing. This is my final product, and it is meant to be a custom stand for my Dyson AirWrap &trade; hair dryer.
