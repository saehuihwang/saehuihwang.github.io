## Inspiration
We live, think, and remember in a 3D world—so why are we still using 2D surfaces to store our thoughts? Inspired by the method of loci—an ancient mnemonic technique where memories are tied to specific physical locations—we harness the human brain’s innate spatial memory. By turning notetaking into an immersive, spatio-temporal activity, we activate the brain’s parietal cortex to organize and recall information naturally and intuitively. This prototype bridges cognition and technology, unlocking the full potential of human memory and creativity.

## What it does
Picture this: learning Spanish vocabulary becomes intuitive—el sofá belongs in your virtual living room, while el libro rests on a shelf. FLAP is a tool that transforms how you organize and remember information by leveraging the power of spatial memory. Everyday tasks? Imagine a to-do list where household chores are anchored in the laundry room, groceries in the kitchen, and work projects on your desk—instantly reducing cognitive load and boosting productivity. Need to prepare for a speech? Place your key points in spatial locations: the introduction by the entrance, core arguments in the center, and the conclusion near the exit. By walking through your ideas, you naturally strengthen understanding and recall.

Like butterflies settling in a garden, ideas are put in space. Instead of forcing our naturally spatial thinking into flat diagrams, Flap lets our ideas exist where they make the most sense – in the rich, three-dimensional world we actually live in.
