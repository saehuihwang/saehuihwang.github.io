  Environmental Adaptability of Legged Robots with Cutaneous Inflation and Sensation
abstract: >
  In this article, a novel approach to enhance the maneuverability and adaptability of legged robots in challenging environments is proposed. This approach involves the integration of soft inflatable sensing skin, which provides additional mobile modes and environmental adaptability. The inflated skin's structural properties, such as buoyancy, volumed shape, and physical compliance, enable quadruped robots to extend their mobility to stable swimming and crawling modes. The inflated skin also offers physical protection through cushioning and backing effects, allowing robots to roll down stair-like structures. Furthermore, the integration of tactile sensors provides the host robot with accurate and intuitive contact information, enabling increased environmental adaptability and responsive behavior. The robot can protect itself from impacts, detect and detour obstacles, and dynamically interact with its surrounding environment. Overall, the proposed approach offers a synergistic integration of soft inflatable sensing skin and tactile sensors to enhance legged robotsâ€™ maneuverability and adaptability in harsh environments. The integrated system enables robots to achieve challenging missions, extending their capabilities beyond conventional locomotive modes. The proposed approach has significant potential applications in fields such as search and rescue, surveillance, and exploration.
